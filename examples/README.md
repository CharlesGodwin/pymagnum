__WARNING__ There have been changes to the `paho.mqtt` package that is used by `mqttlogger.py` and `mqttlogger-2.py`. This is causing this message to be emitted at program startup.
`DeprecationWarning: Callback API version 1 is deprecated, update to latest version`

This is a benign warning message. mqttlogger-2.py has been revised to work ONLY with Version 2.0.
