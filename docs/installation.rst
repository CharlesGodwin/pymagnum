`The Python package site <https://pypi.org/project/pymagnum/>`_

Installation Detail
===================

Throughout this documentation, ``python`` and its installer ``pip`` are referred to using the default convention of a python.
If you are using an older OS, such as Buster on a Raspberry Pi, Use ``python3`` and ``pip3`` to  refer to Python 3 versions of the programs. This software requires a minimum of
version 3.7 of Python.

| You will need pip installed. On a Pi use:
| ``sudo apt install python3-pip``

| Then install or upgrade this software package using:
| ``sudo pip install --upgrade pymagnum``

If you are using Python 3.11 or higher, you may be greeted by ``error: externally-managed-environment``.
You can install ``pymagnum`` in a virtual environment to avoid this message, but then you can only use magnum program when you enable this virtualenv first.
If you want to ignore this annoyance, you can just add the ``--break-system-packages`` flag and go on with your day.

If you want to check which version is have installed on your system, run this command:
``sudo pip show pymagnum``

.. _testing:

Testing
=======

Once this software is installed, test the interconnect hardware:

| First determine your serial device by running
| ``python -m serial.tools.list_ports``
| Normally a USB device will show up as ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` and a HAT as ``/dev/ttyAMA0`` or ``/dev/ttyS0``

| Next run the provided test program
| ``magtest --help``
| will tell you choices.

Usually you just need to run
``magtest --device /dev/ttyUSB0`` or other device name.
This should show up to 50 packets with names. such as:

Troubleshooting
===============

If nothing happens or you get a lot of UNKNOWN lines, try these trouble shooting routines.

**Timeout is too short**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One problem is that the default settings for determining the end of a packet
is not right for your setup. try increasing the timeout by adding this to your test
``magtest --timeout 0.005 -d /dev/ttyUSB0``

Increase the value if necessary.


**Reverse Wiring**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

try reversing the two wires on your setup and repeating the test. Also double check you
are referencing the right device. HAT serial device can be either
``/dev/ttyAMA0`` or ``/dev/ttyS0``. Try both. If that fails contact the
author using :ref:`feedback`.

Hereâ€™s an example of results if the wires are switched

**System Startup**
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some systems have encountered problems with stray voltage being sent to the RS-485 device if this software
starts too soon after initial system boot. The symptom of this is flickering in the inverter. To reduce the risk of this happening, this software delays initializing
the serial interface for 30 seconds after boot time.
This delay can modified, please refer to source named magnum.py for details, or contact the author using :ref:`feedback`.
