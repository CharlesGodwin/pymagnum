`The Python package site <https://pypi.org/project/pymagnum/>`_

Installation
============

Throughout this documentation ``python`` and its installer ``pip`` are
refered to using the default convention of a Raspberry Pi. The term
``python3`` and ``pip3`` refer to Python 3 versions of the programs. On
other systems the default installation may be Python 3, so just use
``python`` and ``pip`` in those systems. This software requires a minimum of
version 3.5 of Python.

| You will need pip3 installed. On a Pi use:
| ``sudo apt install python3-pip``

| Then install or upgrade this software package using:
| ``sudo pip3 install --upgrade pymagnum``

.. _testing:

Testing
=======

Once this software is installed, test the interconnect hardware:

| First determine your serial device by running
| ``python3 -m serial.tools.list_ports``
| Normally a USB device will show
  up as ``/dev/ttyUSB0`` and a HAT as ``/dev/ttyAMA0`` or ``/dev/ttyS0``

| Next run the provided test program
| ``python3 -m magnum.tools.magtest --help``
| will tell you choices.

Usually you just need to run
``python3 -m magnum.tools.magtest -d /dev/ttyUSB0`` or other device
name.
This should show up to 50 packets with names. such as: ::

If nothing happens or you get a lot of UNKNOWN lines, try reversing the
two wires on your setup and repeating the test. Also double check you
are referencing the right device. HAT serial device can be either
``/dev/ttyAMA0`` or ``/dev/ttyS0``. Try both. If that fails contact the
author using :ref:`feedback`.

Hereâ€™s an example of results if the wires are switched::
