Your feedback is important. I want to hear the good, the bad and the
ugly. I would also like to know of any enhancements you would like. The
way to provide open feed back is to start a discussion https://github.com/CharlesGodwin/pymagnum/discussions

If you open or watch an issue or discussion, you will receive emails from GitHub. Your replies to the emails will become part of the public comment thread of the discussion or issue.
